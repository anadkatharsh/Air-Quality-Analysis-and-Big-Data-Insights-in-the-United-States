Air Quality Analysis and Big Data Insights in the United States
Project Description
This project, Air Quality Analysis and Big Data Insights in the United States, investigates air quality trends across the country using extensive datasets and advanced analytical techniques. The study aims to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies in air pollution levels, focusing on key pollutants such as PM2.5, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. By leveraging big data tools and visualization techniques, this project provides actionable insights for policymakers, environmental agencies, and the public to address air quality challenges effectively.

Key Findings & Results
Air Quality Trends:

Seasonal variations were observed in pollutant levels, with higher concentrations during colder months for certain pollutants like PM2.5.

Urban areas exhibited consistently higher pollution levels compared to rural regions due to industrial activities and vehicular emissions.

Correlations and Anomalies:

Strong correlations were found between PM2.5 levels and health-related outcomes in specific regions.

Anomalous spikes in pollution were linked to events such as wildfires and industrial accidents.

Visualization & Dashboards:

Interactive dashboards were developed to visualize air quality data dynamically, enabling users to explore trends by region, time, and pollutant type.

Tools & Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Big Data Tools: Apache Spark (for large-scale data processing)

Visualization Tools: Dashboards built with Python Dash

Data Sources: Publicly available air quality datasets from government agencies like the EPA
